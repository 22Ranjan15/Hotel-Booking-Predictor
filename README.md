## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Model Selection
For detailed information on the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), model selection process, and experimental results, please refer to the Jupyter Notebook: [`experiments.ipynb`](experiments.ipynb).

Key highlights from the EDA and model selection process:

* **Data Exploration:** The dataset was found to be imbalanced in terms of **`booking status`**. Important features identified during EDA included `lead_time`, `avg_price_per_room`, and `no_of_special_requests`. Distributions and outliers were analyzed using histograms and boxplots.

* **Feature Engineering:** Label encoding was applied to convert categorical variables (like `room_type_reserved`, `type_of_meal_plan`, and others) into numerical form for modeling.

* **Model Selection:** Although `RandomForestClassifier` had the highest **F1 score (0.89, 168 MB)**, `LightGBM` offered a better trade-off with an **F1 score of 0.86 and a model size of just 3 MB**. Thus, `LightGBM` was chosen and trained on preprocessed, balanced data.

* **Model Performance:** To evaluate performance, **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1 Score** were used. Among all models, `LightGBM` achieved a strong F1 score of 0.8692 with a minimal model size, making it the final choice.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* Python 3.10
* Google Cloud SDK
* Docker
* Jenkins

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/22Ranjan15/Hotel-Booking-Predictor.git
    cd "Hotel Reservations Prediction"
    ```

2.  Set up your Google Cloud credentials.  
    > üí°Follow the [Google Cloud documentation](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/provide-credentials-adc) for instructions.

3.  Install the required Python dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  Set up Google Cloud Storage:

    * Create a Google Cloud Storage bucket in your Google Cloud project.

    * Update the connection settings in your application to use Google Cloud Storage instead of a database. This may involve using the `google-cloud-storage` python package to upload and retrieve data from your bucket.

    * Update the necessary environment variables or configuration files with your Google Cloud Storage credentials and bucket name.


5.  Set up environment variables:

    * Create a `.env` file and add necessary environment variables like:
        
        * GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=path_to_your_google_cloud_credentials.json

        * BUCKET_NAME=your_bucket_name

### Usage

1. To run the Flask web application locally:

    ```bash
    python app.py 
    ```

    The application will be accessible at **`http://localhost:8080`**
    > ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Flask runs on port `5000` by default unless explicitly configured to use `8080`.

2. To build and run the Docker container:

    ```bash
    docker build -t hotel-cancellation-app .
    docker run -p 8080:5000 hotel-cancellation-app
    ```

    The application will be accessible at **`http://localhost:8080`**.  
    > This maps port 8080 on your machine to port 5000 inside the container (where Flask is running).


3. To trigger the Jenkins CI/CD pipeline:

    - Make sure Jenkins is properly configured with:
      - Access to your GitHub repository.
      - A pipeline defined in a `Jenkinsfile` (either in the repo or configured via Jenkins UI).
      - Required credentials and environment variables set (e.g., Google Cloud credentials for accessing GCS).
    
    - **To trigger automatically**:
      - Push a commit to the repository.
      - Jenkins should be configured with a webhook or polling to detect changes and start the pipeline automatically.

    - **To trigger manually**:
      - Open Jenkins in your browser.
      - Navigate to your project/job.
      - Click on **‚ÄúBuild Now‚Äù** to start the pipeline.

    - The pipeline can include stages such as:
      - Installing dependencies
      - Running unit tests
      - Building the Docker image
      - Pushing the image to a container registry (optional)
      - Deploying the application (optional)


## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Deployment

The application is deployed on Google Cloud Platform.  Specific services used include:

- [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage): Used for storing and accessing data files such as datasets and prediction results.
- [Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run): Used to deploy and run the containerized Flask application in a serverless environment with auto-scaling.
- [Google Container Registry (GCR)](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry): Used to store and manage Docker container images.
- [Google Cloud Service Account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts): Used to authenticate and authorize secure access to Google Cloud resources.


### Deployment Architecture

- The Flask application is containerized using Docker and pushed to **Google Container Registry**.

- **Google Cloud Run** pulls the container image from GCR and deploys it in a fully managed serverless environment.

- The application communicates with **Google Cloud Storage** to read/write data.

- A **Service Account** with appropriate IAM roles is used to grant secure, least-privilege access to GCS from the application.


### Access

Once deployed, the application is accessible via a public HTTPS URL provided by **Cloud Run**. Authentication settings (public/private) can be configured based on project requirements.

> üí° For more on securing and scaling your Cloud Run app, refer to the [Cloud Run documentation](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs).

## üìà Performance

The selected model, **LightGBM**, achieved the following performance metrics:

- **Accuracy**: `86.53%`
- **Precision**: `85.04%`
- **Recall**: `88.89%`
- **F1 Score**: `86.92%`

### Additional Notes

- These metrics reflect the model's evaluation on the test dataset.

- LightGBM performed competitively among all tested models, achieving one of the highest F1 Scores.

- The model demonstrates a strong balance between precision and recall, making it effective for reducing both false positives and false negatives.

> üí° You can further improve the performance by tuning hyperparameters or using ensemble techniques.
